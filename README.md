## Assignment Overview

### i. Object Modeling Techniques (OMT) [1 Mark]
**Definition:**  
Object Modeling Techniques (OMT) is a method for modeling and designing systems using object-oriented concepts. Developed by James Rumbaugh, OMT is a key component of object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). It employs graphical notations to represent objects, classes, relationships, and other aspects of an object-oriented system.

### ii. Comparison of OOAD and OOP [2 Marks]
**Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD):**
- Encompasses both analysis and design phases.
- Emphasis on understanding the problem domain and defining system requirements.

**Object Analysis and Design (OOP):**
- Primarily refers to the design phase.
- Focuses on system architecture, classes, and interactions based on the analysis.

### iii. Main Goals of UML [2 Marks]
Unified Modeling Language (UML) Goals:
1. **Visual Modeling:** Standardize system visualization using diagrams.
2. **Specification:** Define system structure and behavior.
3. **Documentation:** Document design decisions and system architecture.
4. **Construction:** Assist in system implementation.
5. **Communication:** Facilitate communication among stakeholders.

### iv. Advantages of Object-Oriented Information System Development
1. **Inheritance and Code Reusability:**
   - Inheritance allows new classes to inherit attributes and behaviors.
   
2. **Encapsulation and Information Hiding:**
   - Encapsulation supports hiding internal state, exposing a well-defined interface.

3. **Modularity and Reusability:**
   - Promotes modular design, breaking systems into manageable object units.

### v. Types of Associations in Object-Oriented [Relationships]
1. **Association:**
   - Represents a bi-directional relationship between two or more classes.

2. **Aggregation:**
   - Specific association where one class represents a whole, and another represents its part.

3. **Composition:**
   - Stronger form of aggregation, indicating a "owns" relationship with parts dependent on the whole's lifetime.

### vi. Class Diagram Explanation
**Class Diagram:**
- **Definition:** A visual representation of the structure and relationships of classes in a system.
- **Usage:** Used for system visualization, design documentation, and communication among stakeholders.

**Steps to Draw a Class Diagram:**
1. **Identify Classes:** Identify the main classes in the system.
2. **Define Attributes and Methods:** For each class, define its attributes and methods.
3. **Establish Relationships:** Define relationships between classes (association, aggregation, composition).
4. **Draw Diagram:** Represent classes, attributes, methods, and relationships using UML notation.

**Example:**
Consider a "Library Management System."
- Classes: `Book`, `Library`, `Member`
- Relationships: `Book` is associated with `Library` and `Member`.
